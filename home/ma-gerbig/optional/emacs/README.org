This is my personal GNU Emacs configuration file, inspired by a bunch of resources I’ve found online.
The =early-init.el= and =init.el= files are generated from this =*.org= document with =C-c C-v t=.

* Early System Configuration
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle early-init.el
:END:

#+begin_quote
Emacs 27.1 introduced =early-init.el=, which is run before =init.el=, before package and UI initialization happens, and before site files are loaded.
#+end_quote

** File Headers
We start by simply defining the standard headers used by the two files.
These headers contain either some Emacs-LISP relevant indicators like =lexical-binding=, or instructions about the contents of the file.

** Garbage Collection
A big contributor to startup times is garbage collection.
We up the gc threshold to temporarily prevent it from running, then reset it later by enabling =gcmh-mode=.
Not resetting it will cause stuttering/freezes.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum ; 2^61 bytes
        gc-cons-percentage 0.6)
#+end_src

** Disable package-enable-at-startup
#+begin_quote
Package initialize occurs automatically, before =user-init-file= is loaded, but after =early-init-file=. We handle package initialization, so we must prevent Emacs from doing it early!
#+end_quote

Prevent =package.el= loading packages prior to their init-file loading.
While it is technically possible to use both =package.el= and =straight.el= at the same time, there is no real reason to, and it might result in oddities like packages getting loaded more than once.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
#+end_src

Prevent Emacs loading outdatet packages.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq load-prefer-newer t)
#+end_src

** Unset file-name-handler-alist
Every file opened and loaded by Emacs will run through this list to check for a proper handler for the file, but during startup, it won’t need any of them.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defvar file-name-handler-alist-original file-name-handler-alist)
  (setq file-name-handler-alist nil)
#+end_src

** Disable unnecessary interfaces.
It will be faster to disable them here before they've been initialized.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq-default
   default-frame-alist
   '((horizontal-scroll-bars . nil)       ; No horizontal scroll-bars
     (left-fringe . 10)                   ; Thin left fringe
     ;;(menu-bar-lines . 0)                 ; No menu bar
     (right-divider-width . 1)            ; Thin vertical window divider
     (right-fringe . 10)                  ; Thin right fringe
     (tool-bar-lines . 0)                 ; No tool bar
     (vertical-scroll-bars . nil)))       ; No vertical scroll-bars
#+end_src

** Restore some values after Emacs is started.
#+begin_quote
The =emacs-startup-hook= runs later than the =after-init-hook=.
One key difference is that there may be command-line options processed after the after-init-hook and before the emacs-startup-hook.
(Command-line options are handled in multiple phases, with some being processed right away and some after init files have been loaded.)

* Basic System Configuraten
** Packagemanagement with straight.el
Init-file and version lockfiles as the sole source of truth.
No persistent state kept elsewhere.
100% reproducible package management, accounting for changes in packages, recipe repositories, configuration, and the package manager itself.
#+begin_quote
Note: =straight.el= supports a minimum version of Emacs 25.1, and works on macOS, Windows, and most flavors of Linux. You must install Git in order to use =straight.el=.
#+end_quote

=straight.el= determines your package management configuration from two, and only two, sources: the contents of your init-file, and your version lockfiles.
To write the current revisions of all your packages into version lockfiles, run =M-x straight-freeze-versions=.
This will first check that =straight.el= has an up-to-date account of what packages are installed by your init-file, then ensure that all your local changes are pushed (remember, we are aiming for perfect reproducibility!).

For updading the packages run =M-x straight-pull-package= to get the latest version of a given package (or =M-x straight-pull-all= to update everything), and then =M-x straight-freeze-versions= to persist the on-disk versions to your lockfile (=~/.emacs.d/straight/versions/default.el= by default).
You can run =M-x straight-thaw-versions= at any time to reset on-disk packages to their locked versions, making your config totally reproducible across environments. 

Sometimes it's good to clean up unused repositories if I've removed packages from my configuration.  Use =straight-remove-unused-repos= for this purpose.

Let's bootstrap [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] with:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar bootstrap-version)
(let ((bootstrap-file
       (expand-file-name
        "straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el"
        (or (bound-and-true-p straight-base-dir)
            user-emacs-directory)))
      (bootstrap-version 7))
  (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file)
    (with-current-buffer
        (url-retrieve-synchronously
         "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radian-software/straight.el/develop/install.el"
         'silent 'inhibit-cookies)
      (goto-char (point-max))
      (eval-print-last-sexp)))
  (load bootstrap-file nil 'nomessage))
#+end_src

Load the helper package for commands like `straight-x-clean-unused-repos'
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'straight-x)
#+end_src

If [[https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec][watchexec]] and [[https://www.python.org/][Python 3]] are installed, use file watchers to detect package modifications.
This saves time at startup.
Otherwise, use the ever-reliable =find(1)=.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (if (and (executable-find "watchexec")
           (executable-find "python3"))
      (setq straight-check-for-modifications '(watch-files find-when-checking))
    (setq straight-check-for-modifications
          '(find-at-startup find-when-checking)))
#+end_src

*** Integration with use-package
=use-package= is a macro that provides convenient syntactic sugar for many common tasks related to installing and configuring Emacs packages.
Of course, it does not actually install the packages, but instead defers to a package manager, =like straight.el= (which comes with =use-package= integration by default).

To use =use-package=, first install it with =straight.el=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (straight-use-package 'use-package)
#+end_src

Use =straight.el= for =use-package= expressions:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq straight-use-package-by-default t)    
#+end_src

Like =use-package=, but with =straight-use-package-by-default= disabled.
NAME and ARGS are as in =use-package=.

The =global-auto-revert-mode= will make Emacs watch the files for all open buffers for changes on disk and it will autmatically refresh those buffers if they don't have unsaved changes!
The same applys to =global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers= for directories.

** Keep emacs.d clean
The default paths used to store configuration files and persistent data are not consistent across Emacs packages.
This isn't just a problem with third-party packages but even with built-in packages.

Some packages put these files directly in =user-emacs-directory= or $HOME or in a subdirectory of either of the two or elsewhere.
Furthermore sometimes file names are used that don't provide any insight into what package might have created them.

[[https://github.com/emacscollective/no-littering][No-littering]] sets out to fix this by changing the values of path variables to put configuration files in =no-littering-etc-directory= (defaulting to "etc/" under =user-emacs-directory=, thus usually "~/.config/emacs/etc/") and persistent data files in =no-littering-var-directory= (defaulting to "var/" under =user-emacs-directory=, thus usually "~/.emacs.d/var/"), and by using descriptive file names and subdirectories when appropriate.
This is similar to a color-theme; a "path-theme" if you will.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

** Doom Theme
=doom-modeline= is a fancy and fast mode-line inspired by minimalism design
NOTE: The first time you load your configuration on a new machine, you'll need to run the following command interactively so that mode line icons display correctly =M-x nerd-icons-install-fonts=.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
  (use-package nerd-icons)
  (use-package doom-modeline
    :ensure t
    :hook (after-init . doom-modeline-mode)
    ;; :custom ((setq doom-modeline-height 15)))
    )
